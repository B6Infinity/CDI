# C.D.I. (Cool Desktop Interface)
This is a project to make the desktop look more futuristic and stuff like that... Idk what I'm doing.... The plan is to make a shell command to execute a python script on every startup.
That should open up a browser window in full screen... (I know it's pretty naive... But... Yeah!)
